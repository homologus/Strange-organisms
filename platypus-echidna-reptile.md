Platypus, Echidna, and Reptilian Egg Laying:

How similar is the genetic code that allows platypuses and echidnas to lay eggs to the genetic code for the same function in reptiles?

Platypus genome has already been sequenced. Genome size is 2.2 billion neucleotides.
I was not able to find accounts of the echidna genome actually having been sequenced, though the 10k genome project announced that they were going to do it at one point. There have been studies using the transcriptome and genome painting of echidna, but no recorded full genome sequence. (Several sources have even mentioned that it is good that we have a platypuis genome while remaining silent on the echidna matter)

If we assume echidna genome size is similar to the genome size of the platypus, that means it also has ~2.2 billion neucleotides.
If we want to sequence using Pacbio sequencing technology, the average amount of times you want each part of the genome to be sequenced is 30.
